# GeneIdent
Together with the [ABIF Converter](https://github.com/OpenChrom/abifconverter) it can be used to display gene sequences from raw data and initiate a [queued NCBI BLAST database search](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Web/Newsltr/Summer99/qblast.html) in OpenChrom with the help of [BioJava](http://biojava.org/).
